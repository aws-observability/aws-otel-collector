The probabilistic sampler processor supports several modes of sampling
for spans and log records.  Sampling is performed on a per-request
basis, considering individual items statelessly.  For whole trace
sampling, see
[tailsamplingprocessor](../tailsamplingprocessor/README.md).

For trace spans, this sampler supports probabilistic sampling based on
a configured sampling percentage applied to the TraceID.  In addition,
the sampler recognizes a `sampling.priority` annotation, which can
force the sampler to apply 0% or 100% sampling.

For log records, this sampler can be configured to use the embedded
TraceID and follow the same logic as applied to spans.  When the
TraceID is not defined, the sampler can be configured to apply hashing
to a selected log record attribute.  This sampler also supports
sampling priority.

## Consistency guarantee

A consistent probability sampler is a Sampler that supports
independent sampling decisions for each span or log record in a group
(e.g. by TraceID), while maximizing the potential for completeness as
follows.

Consistent probability sampling requires that for any span in a given
trace, if a Sampler with lesser sampling probability selects the span
for sampling, then the span would also be selected by a Sampler
configured with greater sampling probability.

## Completeness property

A trace is complete when all of its members are sampled.  A
"sub-trace" is complete when all of its descendents are sampled.

Ordinarily, Trace and Logging SDKs configure parent-based samplers
which decide to sample based on the Context, because it leads to
completeness.

When non-root spans or logs make independent sampling decisions
instead of using the parent-based approach (e.g., using the
`TraceIDRatioBased` sampler for a non-root span), incompleteness may
result, and when spans and log records are independently sampled in a
processor, as by this component, the same potential for completeness
arises.  The consistency guarantee helps minimimize this issue.

Consistent probability samplers can be safely used with a mixture of
probabilities and preserve sub-trace completeness, provided that child
spans and log records are sampled with probability greater than or
equal to the parent context.

Using 1%, 10% and 50% probabilities for example, in a consistent
probability scheme the 50% sampler must sample when the 10% sampler
does, and the 10% sampler must sample when the 1% sampler does.  A
three-tier system could be configured with 1% sampling in the first
tier, 10% sampling in the second tier, and 50% sampling in the bottom
tier.  In this configuration, 1% of traces will be complete, 10% of
traces will be sub-trace complete at the second tier, and 50% of
traces will be sub-trace complete at the third tier thanks to the
consistency property.

These guidelines should be considered when deploying multiple
collectors with different sampling probabilities in a system.  For
example, a collector serving frontend servers can be configured with
smaller sampling probability than a collector serving backend servers,
without breaking sub-trace completeness.

## Sampling randomness

To achieve consistency, sampling randomness is taken from a
deterministic aspect of the input data.  For traces pipelines, the
source of randomness is always the TraceID.  For logs pipelines, the
source of randomness can be the TraceID or another log record
attribute, if configured.

For log records, the `attribute_source` and `from_attribute` fields determine the
source of randomness used for log records.  When `attribute_source` is
set to `traceID`, the TraceID will be used.  When `attribute_source`
is set to `record` or the TraceID field is absent, the value of
`from_attribute` is taken as the source of randomness (if configured).

## Sampling priority

The sampling priority mechanism is an override, which takes precedence
over the probabilistic decision in all modes.

ðŸ›‘ Compatibility note: Logs and Traces have different behavior.

In traces pipelines, when the priority attribute has value 0, the
configured probability will by modified to 0% and the item will not
pass the sampler.  When the priority attribute is non-zero the
configured probability will be set to 100%.  The sampling priority
attribute is not configurable, and is called `sampling.priority`.

In logs pipelines, when the priority attribute has value 0, the
configured probability will by modified to 0%, and the item will not
pass the sampler.  Otherwise, the logs sampling priority attribute is
interpreted as a percentage, with values >= 100 equal to 100%
sampling.  The logs sampling priority attribute is configured via
`sampling_priority`.

## Sampling algorithm

### Hash seed

The hash seed method uses the FNV hash function applied to either a
Trace ID (spans, log records), or to the value of a specified
attribute (only logs).  The hashed value, presumed to be random, is
compared against a threshold value that corresponds with the sampling
percentage.

This mode requires configuring the `hash_seed` field.  This mode is
enabled when the `hash_seed` field is not zero, or when log records
are sampled with `attribute_source` is set to `record`.

In order for hashing to be consistent, all collectors for a given tier
(e.g. behind the same load balancer) must have the same
`hash_seed`. It is also possible to leverage a different `hash_seed`
at different collector tiers to support additional sampling
requirements.

This mode uses 14 bits of sampling precision.

### Error handling

This processor considers it an error when the arriving data has no
randomess.  This includes conditions where the TraceID field is
invalid (16 zero bytes) and where the log record attribute source has
zero bytes of information.

By default, when there are errors determining sampling-related
information from an item of telemetry, the data will be refused.  This
behavior can be changed by setting the `fail_closed` property to
false, in which case erroneous data will pass through the processor.

## Configuration

The following configuration options can be modified:

- `sampling_percentage` (32-bit floating point, required): Percentage at which items are sampled; >= 100 samples all items, 0 rejects all items.
- `hash_seed` (32-bit unsigned integer, optional, default = 0): An integer used to compute the hash algorithm. Note that all collectors for a given tier (e.g. behind the same load balancer) should have the same hash_seed.
- `fail_closed` (boolean, optional, default = true): Whether to reject items with sampling-related errors.

### Logs-specific configuration

- `attribute_source` (string, optional, default = "traceID"): defines where to look for the attribute in from_attribute. The allowed values are `traceID` or `record`.
- `from_attribute` (string, optional, default = ""): The name of a log record attribute used for sampling purposes, such as a unique log record ID. The value of the attribute is only used if the trace ID is absent or if `attribute_source` is set to `record`.
- `sampling_priority` (string, optional, default = ""): The name of a log record attribute used to set a different sampling priority from the `sampling_percentage` setting. 0 means to never sample the log record, and >= 100 means to always sample the log record.

Examples:

Sample 15% of log records according to trace ID using the OpenTelemetry
specification.

```yaml
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler:
    sampling_percentage: 15
```

Sample logs according to their logID attribute:

```yaml
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler:
    sampling_percentage: 15
    attribute_source: record # possible values: one of record or traceID
    from_attribute: logID # value is required if the source is not traceID
```

Give sampling priority to log records according to the attribute named
`priority`:

```yaml
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler:
    sampling_percentage: 15
    sampling_priority: priority
```
