| `retry_on_failure.enabled`          | `false`      | If `true`, the receiver will pause reading a file and attempt to resend the current batch of logs if it encounters an error from downstream components.                                                                                                                                         |
| `retry_on_failure.initial_interval` | `1 second`   | Time to wait after the first failure before retrying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `retry_on_failure.max_elapsed_time` | `5 minutes`  | Maximum amount of time (including retries) spent trying to send a logs batch to a downstream consumer. Once this value is reached, the data is discarded. Retrying never stops if set to `0`.                                                                                                   |

### Operators

Each operator performs a simple responsibility, such as parsing a timestamp or JSON. Chain together operators to process logs into a desired format.

- Every operator has a `type`.
- Every operator can be given a unique `id`. If you use the same type of operator more than once in a pipeline, you must specify an `id`. Otherwise, the `id` defaults to the value of `type`.
- Operators will output to the next operator in the pipeline. The last operator in the pipeline will emit from the receiver. Optionally, the `output` parameter can be used to specify the `id` of another operator to which logs will be passed directly.
- Only parsers and general purpose operators should be used.

### UDP Configuration

| Field             | Default          | Description                                                                       |
| ---               | ---              | ---                                                                               |
| `listen_address`  | required         | A listen address of the form `<ip>:<port>`                                        |

### TCP Configuration

| Field             | Default          | Description                                                                       |
| ---               | ---              | ---                                                                               |
| `max_buffer_size` | `1024kib`        | Maximum size of buffer that may be allocated while reading TCP input              |
| `listen_address`  | required         | A listen address of the form `<ip>:<port>`                                        |
| `tls`             |                  | An optional `TLS` configuration (see the TLS configuration section)               |

#### TLS Configuration

The `tcp_input` operator supports TLS, disabled by default.

| Field             | Default          | Description                               |
| ---               | ---              | ---                                       |
| `cert_file`       |                  | Path to the TLS cert to use for TLS required connections.       |
| `key_file`        |                  | Path to the TLS key to use for TLS required connections.|
| `ca_file`         |                  | Path to the CA cert. For a client this verifies the server certificate. For a server this verifies client certificates. If empty uses system root CA.  |
| `client_ca_file`  |                  | (optional) Path to the TLS cert to use by the server to verify a client certificate. This sets the ClientCAs and ClientAuth to RequireAndVerifyClientCert in the TLSConfig. Please refer to godoc.org/crypto/tls#Config for more information. |

## Additional Terminology and Features

- An [entry](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/entry.md) is the base representation of log data as it moves through a pipeline. All operators either create, modify, or consume entries.
- A [field](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/field.md) is used to reference values in an entry.
- A common [expression](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/expression.md) syntax is used in several operators. For example, expressions can be used to [filter](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/filter.md) or [route](../../pkg/stanza/docs/operators/router.md) entries.

### Parsers with Embedded Operations

Many parsers operators can be configured to embed certain followup operations such as timestamp and severity parsing. For more information, see [complex parsers](../../pkg/stanza/docs/types/parsers.md#complex-parsers).

## Example Configurations

TCP Configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  syslog:
    tcp:
      listen_address: "0.0.0.0:54526"
    protocol: rfc5424
```

UDP Configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  syslog:
    udp:
      listen_address: "0.0.0.0:54526"
    protocol: rfc3164
