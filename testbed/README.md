# Introduction

This directory contains end to end testcases based on the [testbed framework](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/testbed).

Each sub directory in this directory should contain testcases for specific components. For example, in the
`sampling` directory, we are storing testcases for the Group by Trace and Tail Sampling processors.
