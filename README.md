### Overview

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector (AWS OTel Collector) is an AWS supported version of the upstream OpenTelemetry Collector and is distributed by Amazon. It supports the selected components from the OpenTelemetry community. It is fully compatible with AWS computing platforms including EC2, ECS and EKS. It enables users to send telemetry data to AWS CloudWatch Metrics, Traces and Logs backends as well as the other supported backends.

See the [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) for more information.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

To build AWS OTel Collector locally, you will need to have Golang installed. You can download and install Golang [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

#### AWS OTel Collector Configuration

We built in a [default configuration](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/config.yaml) to our docker image and other format of release.
So, you can run the AWS OTel Collector out of the box with the default settings.
Also, AWS OTel Collector configuration uses the same configuration syntax/design from [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector)
so you can customize or port your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration files when running AWS OTel Collector. Please refer to the `Try out AWS OTel Collector` section on configuring AWS OTel Collector.

#### Try out AWS OTel Collector

AWS OTel Collector supports all AWS computing platforms and docker/kubernetes. Here are some examples on how to run AWS OTel Collector to send telemetry data:

* [Run it with Docker](docs/developers/docker-demo.md)
* [Run it with ECS](docs/developers/ecs-demo.md)
* [Run it with EKS](docs/developers/eks-demo.md)
* [Run it on AWS Linux EC2](docs/developers/linux-rpm-demo.md)
* [Run it on AWS Windows EC2](docs/developers/windows-other-demo.md)
* [Run it on AWS Debian EC2](docs/developers/debian-deb-demo.md)

#### Build Your Own Artifacts

Use the following instructions to build your own AWS OTel Collector artifacts:

* [Build Docker Image](docs/developers/build-docker.md)
* [Build RPM/Deb/MSI](docs/developers/build-aoc.md)

### Development

See [docs/developers](docs/developers/README.md)

### Release Process

See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for release steps.

### Benchmark

The latest performance report is [here](https://aws-observability.github.io/aws-otel-collector/benchmark/report), while the trends by testcase can be found [here](https://aws-observability.github.io/aws-otel-collector/benchmark/trend).
Both are updated on each successful CI run. The charts use the [github-action-benchmark](https://github.com/benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark) action and uses a modified layout to group the testcases.
The performance test can be conducted by following the [instructions](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-test-framework/blob/terraform/docs/get-performance-model.md) here.

### Support

For each merged pull request, a corresponding image is pushed to [public.ecr.aws/aws-otel-test/adot-collector-integration-test](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-otel-test/adot-collector-integration-test). 
This image is used for the integration tests. You can pull any 
of the images from there, however, we will not support any issues and pull requests for these test 
images.
