### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
To build AWS OTel Collector locally, you will need to have Golang installed. You can download and install Golang [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

#### AWS OTel Collector Configuration
We built in a [default configuration](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/config.yaml) to our docker image and other format of release.
So you can run AWS OTel Collector out of box with the default settings.
Also, AWS OTel Collector configuration uses the same configuration syntax/design from [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector)
so you can customize or porting your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration files when running AWS OTel Collector. please refer `Try out AWS OTel Collector` section on configuring AWS OTel Collector.

#### Try out AWS OTel Collector
AWS OTel Collector supports all AWS computing platforms and docker/kubernetes. Here are some examples on how to run AWS OTel Collector to send telemetry data:
* [Run it with Docker](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/docker-demo.md)
* [Run it with ECS](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/ecs-demo.md)
* [Run it with EKS](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/eks-demo.md)
* [Run it on AWS Linux EC2](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/linux-rpm-demo.md)
* [Run it on AWS Windows EC2](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/windows-other-demo.md)
* [Run it on AWS Debian EC2](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector/blob/main/docs/developers/debian-deb-demo.md)

### Benchmark

AWS OTel Collector is based on the upstream open-telemetry-collector. Here is the benchmark of AWSXRay trace exporter and AWSEMF metrics exporter.

This table shows the performance of AWSEMF exporter against 1kData/sec, 5kData/sec, and 10kData/sec metrics:
