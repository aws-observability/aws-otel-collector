# AWS CloudWatch EMF Exporter for OpenTelemetry Collector

This exporter converts OpenTelemetry metrics to 
[AWS CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format(EMF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format_Specification.html)
and then sends them directly to CloudWatch Logs using the 
[PutLogEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html) API.

## Data Conversion
Convert OpenTelemetry ```Int64DataPoints```, ```DoubleDataPoints```, ```SummaryDataPoints``` metrics datapoints into CloudWatch ```EMF``` structured log formats and send it to CloudWatch. Logs and Metrics will be displayed in CloudWatch console.
